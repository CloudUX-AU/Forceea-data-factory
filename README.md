### Attention to all Forceea users: the automated generation of required fields is deactivated by default in v2.2.0.

This was undocumented in User Guide v2, but is now documented in **User Guide v3**.

If you have any methods which use this feature, the methods will fail. If so, you have 2 options:
- Temporarily use `setRequiredFields(true)`
- Set the definitions of all required fields that are missing (Tip: let Forceea generate the field definitions and then copy these definitions and manually set any changes required).
